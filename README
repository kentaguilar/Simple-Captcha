SimpleCaptcha
Yet another captcha script. The project includes a handler and a demo file. Configuration is done on the Captcha.ashx file. 

This is an upfront concept of a captcha in .NET. Like so,


<img src="Captcha.ashx"/>


Just by making the handler as the source of your image, random alphanumeric characters will automatically be displayed.
